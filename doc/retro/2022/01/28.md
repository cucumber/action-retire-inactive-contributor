## Who

* Kate
* Blaise
* Matt

## What happened

* We talked about example mapping and acceptance criteria
* We set up the probot app and a new repo
* We wrote some scenarios

## Insights

* Blaise: Matt's quote: Acceptance criteria are dangerous, because they can be detailed enough to "look fine"... but not detailed enough to find all the edge cases.
* Appreciative enquiry: a technique for organisational change that focusses on amplifying strengths rather than dealing with problems, via dialogue, focussed on a positive goal.
* Kate
	* Continuity from last week. Feels more productive to have a big picture project. 
	* Mobbing, following the rules. You really have to listen carefully when you're the driver.
* Matt
	* Mob timer, everyone got a go. (https://mobti.me)
	* Scenarios we ended up with look great!
	* Kate and Blaise asking great questions.
	* VSCode Live live share. Fluid to swap drivers.
* Kate: I would like to have the timer locally so I hear the sound and don't have to look at Matt's screen share.
* Matt: Thanks Blaise and Kate for showing up!
